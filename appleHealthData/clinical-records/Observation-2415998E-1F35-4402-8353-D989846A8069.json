  "valueString" : "MRI WHOLE BODY WITHOUT CONTRAST\r\n \r\nReferring clinician's provided indication for this examination in Epic: Research Study\r\n \r\nTECHNIQUE: Whole body multiplanar, multisequence non-contrast MR of the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton. The study is tailored to evaluate the bone marrow.\r\n \r\nCOMPARISON: None\r\n \r\nFINDINGS:\r\n \r\nHead and neck: There are multiple lobular T2 hyperintense lesions with central hypointensity within the left greater than right neck, in keeping with peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The largest lesion in the left neck measures 5.1 cm in long axis.  The lesions involve the exiting cervical and upper thoracic nerves, and also involve the soft tissues.\r\n \r\nThorax: There are multiple peripheral nerve sheath tumors with similar signal characteristics to the aforementioned head and neck lesions, including including lesions along the intercostal and thoracic nerves, with the largest lesion measuring 4.3 cm at the right lung apex/right paraspinal region. \r\n \r\nAbdomen and pelvis: No large lesions.\r\n \r\nLower extremities: No large lesions within the visualized portions.\r\n \r\nUpper extremities: No large lesions within the visualized portions.\r\n \r\nSpine: Evaluation of spinal lesions is limited due to large field-of-view. Apart from the aforementioned peripheral cervical and upper thoracic lesions, no appreciable lesion in the spinal canal. Mild reversal of the normal cervical lordosis with multilevel disc bulges and uncovertebral hypertrophy, but there is no spinal cord compression or signal abnormality noting that evaluation is limited from the large field-of-view. Vertebral body heights are maintained. \r\n ",
