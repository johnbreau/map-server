May, MD (Referring MD)\r\nMedications:                  Monitored Anesthesia Care\r\nComplications:                No immediate complications.\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\r\nProcedure:\r\n     Pre-Anesthesia Assessment:\r\n     - Prior to the procedure, a History and Physical was performed, and \r\n     patient medications and allergies were reviewed. The patient's tolerance \r\n     of previous anesthesia was also reviewed. The risks and benefits of the \r\n     procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed with the \r\n     patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained. \r\n     Prior Anticoagulants: The patient has taken no anticoagulant or \r\n     antiplatelet agents. ASA Grade Assessment: II - A patient with mild \r\n     systemic disease. After reviewing the risks and benefits, the patient \r\n     was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure.\r\n     - Prior Aspirin/ NSAID therapy: The patient has taken no aspirin or \r\n     NSAID medications.\r\n     After obtaining informed consent, the endoscope was passed under direct \r\n     vision. Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, \r\n     and oxygen saturations were monitored continuously. The Endoscope was \r\n     introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the second part of \r\n     duodenum. The upper GI endoscopy was accomplished without difficulty. \r\n     The patient tolerated the procedure well.\r\nFindings:\r\n     Esophagogastric landmarks were identified: the Z-line was found at 40 cm \r\n     from the incisors.\r\n     A 2 cm hiatal hernia was found. The proximal extent of the gastric folds \r\n     (end of tubular esophagus) was 40 cm from the incisors. The hiatal \r\n     narrowing was 42 cm from the incisors.\r\n     The esophagus and gastroesophageal junction were examined with white \r\n     light and narrow band imaging (NBI) from a forward view and retroflexed \r\n     position. There were esophageal mucosal changes suspicious for \r\n     short-segment Barrett's esophagus, classified as Barrett's stage C0-M1 \r\n     per Prague criteria. These changes involved the mucosa extending to the \r\n     Z-line (40 cm from the incisors). Two tongues of salmon-colored mucosa \r\n     were present from 39 to 40 cm. The maximum longitudinal extent of these \r\n     esophageal mucosal changes was 1 cm in length. Mucosa was biopsied with \r\n     a cold forceps for histology in a targeted manner and in 4 quadrants at \r\n     intervals of 0.5 cm in the lower third of the esophagus. One specimen \r\n     bottle was sent to pathology. Verification of patient identification for \r\n     the specimen was done. Estimated blood loss was minimal.\r\n     No other significant abnormalities were identified in a careful \r\n     examination of the esophagus.\r\n     Multiple 4 to 10 mm pedunculated and sessile polyps with no bleeding and \r\n     no stigmata of recent bleeding were found in the gastric fundus and in \r\n     the gastric body. The polyp was removed with a cold snare. Resection and \r\n     retrieval were complete. Verification of patient identification for the \r\n     specimen was done. Estimated blood loss was minimal.\r\n     Normal mucosa was found in the entire examined stomach. Biopsies were \r\n     taken with a cold forceps for Helicobacter pylori testing. Verification \r\n     of patient identification for the specimen was done. Estimated blood \r\n     loss was minimal.\r\n     The gastroesophageal flap valve was visualized endoscopically and \r\n     classified as Hill Grade III (minimal fold, loose to endoscope, hiatal \r\n     hernia likely).\r\n     No gross lesions were noted in the entire examined duodenum.\r\n                                                                               \r\nImpression:                   - Esophagogastric landmarks identified.\r\n                              - 2 cm hiatal hernia.\r\n                              - Esophageal mucosal changes suspicious for \r\n                              short-segment Barrett's esophagus, classified \r\n                              as Barrett's stage C0-M1 per Prague criteria. \r\n                              Biopsied.\r\n                              - Multiple gastric polyps. Resected and \r\n                              retrieved.\r\n                              - Normal mucosa was found in the entire \r\n                              stomach. Biopsied.\r\n                              - Gastroesophageal flap valve classified as \r\n                              Hill Grade III (minimal fold, loose to \r\n                              endoscope, hiatal hernia likely).\r\n                              - No gross lesions in the entire examined \r\n                              duodenum.\r\nEstimated Blood Loss:         Estimated blood loss: none.\r\nRecommendation:               - Patient has a contact number available for \r\n                              emergencies.
