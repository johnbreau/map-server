  "valueString" : "EXAM: MRI SKULL BASE\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATION: schwannomatosis and progressive pain and weakness of neck, shoulder, arm, involving ear \r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON: 6/27/2021 MRI head\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain and MRI face without and with intravenous contrast (skull base protocol including high-resolution fat-suppressed T2, T1, and heavily T2-weighted sequences through the lower half of the head and orbital/sinonasal region, along with 2D FLAIR, DWI, and T1-weighted sequences of the whole brain).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS:\r\nSkull Base: No skull base mass.\r\nSimilar appearance of multiple T2 hyperintense, enhancing lobulated and well marginated lesions scattered throughout the subcutaneous tissues of the upper neck. \r\n*  The largest lesion within the field-of-view is located in the left masticator space anterior to the mandibular ramus measuring approximately 2.5 x 1.5 cm (series 10 image 4), partially included. \r\n*  Partially imaged lesion in the left posterior paraspinal musculature at the C1-2 level filling the left C1 to foramen measuring 1.1 x 2 cm without impression on the thecal sac was only partially imaged on prior overall unchanged. \r\n*  Bilobed lesion in the suboccipital soft tissues extends cranially along the expected course of the greater occipital nerve. The most cranial aspect of this lesion has slightly increased in size measuring approximately 0.8 cm in the transverse dimension, previously 0.4 cm.\r\n*  Unchanged 1.3 x 1.0 cm lesion in the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland (series 10 image 4).\r\n*  Minimally increased size of a 1.1 x 0.9 cm lesion in the posterior left periauricular soft tissues (series 10 image 56), previously 0.9 x 0.8 cm.\r\n*  Increased size of a more superiorly located posteriorly left periarticular soft tissue lesion measuring approximately 1.1 x 0.6 cm, previously approximately 0.9 x 0.3 cm (series 10 image 67).\r\n*  Enhancing soft tissue thickening and enhancement within the external auditory canal just posterior to the tragus measuring up to 0.5 x 0.7 cm, series 10 image 32 which is unchanged from 10/27/2021 when accounting for differences in technique\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlight thinning of the cortex over the right superior semicircular canal which is suboptimally evaluated on MRI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrain: No acute infarction or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No mass. No midline shift. Minimal white matter T2-FLAIR hyperintensities.\r\n\r\n\r\nVentricles: No hydrocephalus. No extra-axial fluid collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntracranial flow voids: Arterial and venous sinus flow voids appear normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther findings: Mucous retention cyst in the floor of the left maxillary sinus. Marked thinning of the arcuate eminence overlying the bilateral superior semicircular canals, particularly on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
